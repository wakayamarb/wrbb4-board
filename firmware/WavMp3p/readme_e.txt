●Outline
 This application program uses GR-CITRUS to plays WAV-file and MP3-file audio stored in the SD memory card. This zip file must be uploaded to Gadget Renesas cloud compiler and be built there. The use and license of this software package is classified under GPL2.

●Supported WAV file specification

	Sampling frequency: 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz (Errors may occur due to use of 48MHz division frequencies.) 
	Number of channels: 1 (the MCU outputs the same stream to 2 output pins) or 2 (stereo) 
	Number of bits: 16 
	File name: 8 characters + “WAV” extension


●Supported MP3 file specification

	Sampling frequency: 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz (Errors may occur due to use of 48MHz division frequencies.) 
	Number of channels: 1 (the MCU outputs the same stream to 2 output pins) or 2 (stereo) 
	Number of bits: 16 
	File name: 8 characters + “MP3” extension





● Cautions and Usage Notes
  The output audio is generated by the PWM waveform. The frequency of the PWM is the sampling frequency of the data. 
When the sampling frequency is within the audible field, a high pitched beep is emitted. Depending on the combination of the sampling frequency, number of channels, number of bits, and PWM frequency, the MCU may not able to generate the audio smoothly.
The type of audio system you connect to this system may cause noise in the audio or, in the worst case scenario, cause damage to the equipment.
Some SD-cards may not work with this application. Please try various vendors’ products to find the appropriate match.
